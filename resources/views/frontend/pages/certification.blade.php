                           We are committed to leaving a legacy of high quality, which is not an end in itself but a means for pursuing excellence and perfection at all times. Both national and international standards for our goods are met by us. Our cutting-edge manufacturing facility complies with international standards and is ISO 9001, ISO 13485, WHO-GMP, and CE certified.
                            GWS has developed a reputation for manufacturing/sourcing various medical and surgical products/devices in its state-of-the-art facilities in a very short period of time.
                            GWS is an agency that operates in an open and transparent manner. Our valued customers often tour our facilities to see the entire manufacturing process, from raw materials to finished goods. If we can't deliver, we won't guarantee the stars. As a result, we have a sizable client base in a variety of countries around the world. GWS goods have made their way into almost every market, either directly or through re-export. Many importers, particularly in a few European countries, buy GWS products and resell them in other countries.
